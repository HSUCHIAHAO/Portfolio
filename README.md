COMP6200 Data Science Portfolio 

# 1. Analysis of Cycling Data

Today, there are two datasets in this portfolio. The first dataset is an export of ride data from [Strava](https://strava.com/), an online social network site for cycling and other sports. Also, the data is about a log of cycling from a man, and time starting from 2018. He use the app called Strava. The data contain like the distance, heart rate, temperature.

The second dataset was collected by an app called GoldenCheetah, and it can do some simple analysis for the ride data. So, we can observe two dataframe and see that whether there is someting interesting in here.

I have merged these two dataset and adjusted the time zone from UTC to Australia/Sydney.
Finally, I have done the data visualization to let everyone some issue in the diagram.


# 2. Analysis of COVID-19 Data

The issue of COVID-19 is a hot topic for everyone needs to know, and I will analyze the live data to let everyone know about the trend.

I choose the sources of data [datahub.io] has data per country up to 2016 in a handy CSV format, it help us to know the density that people affected by COVID-19 on each country.

Finally, I have predicted the trend for some special cases to know which country has tried to ease the epidemic.


# 3. Classifying the genre of book from summaries

Today, I am trying to predict the genre from its summaries. The data is from [CMU Book Summaries Corpus], and it includes 16,559 books. Each of books may have more than one genre. To make our prediction be concisely, I simplify the genre from 227 genres to 5 genres. I name them as target genres, and each book only was predicted as one genre.
